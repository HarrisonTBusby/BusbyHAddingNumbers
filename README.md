# HBusbyAddingNumbers





This program takes 2 user-inputted numbers and adds them together.
The program uses a while loop for playing again and data validation so if the user inputs a name or something that has letters instead of numbers it wont work.

Works as intended without issue. The ending surprised me, but in a good way, it's funny. However it isn't clearly stated that the answer needs to be 'yes', so maybe add a 'yes or no' to the end so people aren't typing keyboard nonsense like me to test the response lol. Also, just a suggestion, you can shorten your 'Console.ReadLine()' and '.ToLower()' into one statement
